Problem:
Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her at s+1/2 km/h, including t minutes.

Solution:
Let the distance be D = 9 km.
Let the time spent in the coffee shop be T_coffee = t / 60 hours.

Case 1: Speed = s km/h, Total time = 4 hours.
The walking time is D/s. So, 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Case 2: Speed = s+2 km/h, Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours.
The walking time is D/(s+2). So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

We have a system of two equations:
1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract equation (2) from (1):
(9/s) - (9/(s+2)) = 4 - 2.4
9 * ( (s+2 - s) / (s*(s+2)) ) = 1.6
9 * ( 2 / (s^2 + 2s) ) = 1.6
18 = 1.6 * (s^2 + 2s)
18 / 1.6 = s^2 + 2s
11.25 = s^2 + 2s
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
Multiply by 4 to remove decimals: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, s = (-8 ± sqrt(64 - 4*4*(-45))) / (2*4)
s = (-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)) / 8
s = (-8 ± sqrt(784)) / 8
s = (-8 ± 28) / 8
Since speed s must be positive, s = (-8 + 28) / 8 = 20 / 8 = 2.5 km/h.

Now find t:
9/2.5 + t/60 = 4
3.6 + t/60 = 4
t/60 = 0.4
t = 24 minutes.

Case 3: Speed = s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.
Total time = Walking time + Coffee time
Total time = (9 km / 3 km/h) + (24 minutes)
Total time = 3 hours + 24 minutes.
In minutes, this is 3 * 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Problem:
Alice and Bob play a game. A stack of n tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either 1 or 4 tokens. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers n <= 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy.

```python

def solve():
    # This is a game theory problem. It can be solved by finding the pattern of winning and losing positions.
    # A position n is a losing position (P-position, previous player wins) if all reachable positions are winning.
    # A position n is a winning position (N-position, next player wins) if there is at least one move to a losing position.
    # The player who starts on a losing position will lose if the other player plays optimally. Bob wins if n is a losing position.
    #
    # Let's analyze the positions:
    # n=0: Empty, the previous player took the last token. Losing position for the person whose turn it is.
    # n=1: Can move to n=0 (Losing). So n=1 is Winning.
    # n=2: Can move to n=1 (Winning). All moves lead to W. So n=2 is Losing.
    # n=3: Can move to n=2 (Losing). So n=3 is Winning.
    # n=4: Can move to n=0 (Losing) or n=3 (Winning). Can move to L, so n=4 is Winning.
    # n=5: Can move to n=4 (W) or n=1 (W). All moves lead to W. So n=5 is Losing.
    # n=6: Can move to n=5 (L) or n=2 (L). Can move to L, so n=6 is Winning.
    #
    # The losing positions seem to be n=0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, ...
    # The moves are -1 and -4. This suggests a pattern modulo (1+4)=5.
    # Let's check:
    # n mod 5 = 0: W (can take 4 to n-4, which is 1 mod 5) No, n=5 is L.

    # L(6) = F (can move to L(5))
    # L(7) = T (moves to L(6)=F, L(3)=F)
    # The losing positions are 0, 2, 5, 7. This is n mod 5 = 0, 2. No, n=5 is 0 mod 5. n=2,7 are 2 mod 5.
    # Let's check n mod 5.
    # n=0: L. n=1: W. n=2: L. n=3: W. n=4: W.
    # n=5: L. n=6: W. n=7: L. n=8: W. n=9: W.
    # It appears that n is a losing position if n % 5 == 0 or n % 5 == 2.
